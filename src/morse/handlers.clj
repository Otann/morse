(comment "Examples of how to use handler definitions"

  ; creates a handler that will react on "/start" command
  (command-fn "start" (fn [{user :from}] (println "Detecte user:" user)))

  ; There is a macro for a shorthand usage
  (command "start" {user :from} (println "Detecte user:" user))

  ; Which you can use without desctructuring syntax
  (command "chroma" message (handle-text message))


  (defhandler handler
    (handler-fn "start"
                (fn [{{id :id :as chat} :chat}]
                  (println "Bot joined new chat: " chat)))

    (command "start" [{{id :id :as chat} :chat}]
      (println "Bot joined new chat: " chat)
      (t/send-text token id "Welcome!"))

    (command "help" {{id :id :as chat} :chat}
      (println "Help was requested in " chat)
      (t/send-text token id "Help is on the way"))

    (message {{id :id} :chat :as message}
      (println "Intercepted message: " message)
      (t/send-text token id "I don't do a whole lot ... yet.")))

  ; then run in your repl:
  (polling/start token bot-api)
